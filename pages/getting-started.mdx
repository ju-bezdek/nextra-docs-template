# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you get up and running with Nextra quickly and easily.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.8 or higher)
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm/yarn package manager
- A **code editor** (we recommend VS Code)
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **Next.js**

You can verify your Node.js installation by running:

```bash
node --version
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your Nextra documentation site:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you're starting from this template, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template.git
cd nextra-docs-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using your preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by checking your `node_modules` folder.

## Quick Start

Now that everything is set up, let's start the development server:

### 1. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Your Browser

### 3. Make Your First Edit

Try editing the `pages/index.mdx` file to see hot-reloading in action. Your changes will appear instantly in the browser.

### 4. Explore the Structure
